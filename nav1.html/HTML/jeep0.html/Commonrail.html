    <center><h2>Common rail</h2></center>
    <p>Common rail direct fuel injection is a direct fuel injection system built around a high-pressure (over 2,000 bar or 200 MPa or 29,000 psi) fuel rail feeding solenoid valves, as opposed to a low-pressure fuel pump feeding unit injectors (or pump nozzles). 
       High-pressure injection delivers power and fuel consumption benefits over earlier lower pressure fuel injection,[citation needed] by injecting fuel as a larger number of smaller droplets, giving a much higher ratio of surface area to volume.
       This provides improved vaporization from the surface of the fuel droplets, and so more efficient combining of atmospheric oxygen with vaporized fuel delivering more complete combustion.
       Common rail injection is widely used in diesel engines. It is also the basis of gasoline direct injection systems used on petrol engines.</p>
