        An image is a visual representation of something. 
        An image can be a two-dimensional (2D) representation, such as a drawing, painting, or photograph, or a three-dimensional (3D) object, such as a carving or sculpture.
         An image may be displayed through other media, including projection on a surface, activation of electronic signals, or digital displays. 
         Two-dimensional images can be still or animated. 
         Still images can usally be reproduced through mechanical means, such as photography, printmaking or photocopying. 
         In some cases, three-dimensional images may also be animated (capable of passive or active motion).
